IdeaSeed
Overview
IdeaSeed acts as an intermediate platform between ideators and investors. The main goal of the project is to transform ideas into reality by providing the necessary support and resources to bring ideas to life.

Name Convention
The project is named "IdeaSeed" because, just like a big tree grows from a small seed, we believe that big ideas can grow from small thoughts. Hence, "IdeaSeed" represents the nurturing of ideas into successful ventures.

Problem Statement
The problem statement is inspired by real-time scenarios where individuals with innovative ideas lack the financial and mentoring support to bring their ideas to fruition.

Real-Time Scenarios Example
During the early days of college, my friends and I had many thoughts about trending tech and solving various problems we encountered. For example, I thought of integrating AR into online shopping to make product selection more feasible. Although we had different mentors, we needed resources to pursue our ideas. In such cases, financial support is crucial.

One day, I saw Snapchat implementing a similar idea in their application during the Halloween week. This situation is common in student life or for young entrepreneurs. Therefore, we created the IdeaSeed platform from this pain point to connect tech enthusiasts and investors in an engaging community platform.

This platform addresses the general human behavior of recognizing problems but not implementing solutions due to a lack of money. IdeaSeed aims to bridge this gap by providing a space for ideators to find the financial support they need.
